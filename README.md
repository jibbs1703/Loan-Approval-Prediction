# LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION MODEL

## Overview 
The use of machine learning models for loan approval predictions is a prime application of classification 
modelling in the loan application process. The classification model can learn patterns from ground truth
to predict new loan application outcomes. The models can provide quicker and more data-driven decisions 
by automating the loan application process by predicting if a credit/loan applicant should be approved or 
declined based on a set of features.

In this project, a loan approval classification model is developed to evaluate a credit/loan applicantâ€™s 
ability and willingness to repay a loan. The model approves or declines an applicant's application once 
the applicant's information is entered , speeding up the loan underwriting process. 

The model deployment is done using FastAPI, allowing API endpoints to be created. The model is deployed in a
docker container, leveraging cloud resources(AWS EC2 for computing and AWS S3 Bucket for data warehousing) 
for deployment.
